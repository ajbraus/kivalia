  <h4>What Information we collect</h4>
  <p>
  The types of personal information we collect depends on the products and services you use. It
  may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Your contact information such as your name, address, phone, and email</li>
  <li>Information that we use to verify your identity, make decisions about your loan application,
  or manage risk such as your date of birth, social security number, your credit history, your
  credit scores, and your payment history</li>
  <li>Information about your education, such as your degree, SAT scores, your college, your

  tax returns, W-2, brokerage statements, and pay stubs</li>
  <li>Information about you when you visit the Site, including information submitted by you or
  our other customers when interacting with the Site’s features and using its online communication features</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  In addition, when you visit the Site or use the products and services available on the Site
  we automatically collect certain information from your computer, mobile phone or other access
  device. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each
  time you access the Site. When you use the Site, our servers automatically record certain log
  file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request,
  Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks
  and how you interact with links on the Site, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and
  other such information. When you use the Site, we may also employ clear gifs (also known
  as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users.
  In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which
  emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more
  accurate reporting and improvement of the Site. Although you may not opt out of receiving
  online advertisements generally, you may control the collection of data on our Site used for
  targeted advertising during your visits to other websites.
  To opt-out of this data collection for targeted advertising on other sites, click

  <div class="vspacing-pd-sm">
  <h4>Information we receive from third parties</h4>
  <p>
  We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access the Site
  through a third-party connection or log-in, such as LinkedIn or a referral partner, or otherwise
  link an account to the Site, that third party may pass certain information about you and your
  use of its service to us. This information could include the user ID associated with your
  account (for example, your LinkedIn UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any
  information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you
  have made public in connection with that service. You should always review and, if necessary,
  adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking them to the
  Site. You may also unlink your third party account from the Site by adjusting your settings on
  the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information
  collected about you in connection with that service.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="vspacing-pd-sm">
  <h4>How we collect information</h4>
  <p>We collect information about you:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>From you when you register on the Site, use the Site, apply for a loan or to be a investor,
  and from your transactions, including your security purchases, repayments, account funding and
  withdrawals, and your communications with us;</li>
  <li>From third parties such as credit bureaus, identity verification services and other public
  records or websites; and</li>
  <li>From third parties who are participating in the Referral Program (see below)</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="vspacing-pd-sm">
  <h4>Why we collect information</h4>
  <p>We collect this information from you in order to: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>provide you and other customers with access to the products and services offered through the Site,</li>
  <li>provide notices and other information to you about, or in connection with, these products and services,</li>
  <li>provide customer support,</li>
  <li>protect against fraud, fulfill legal requirements and enforce our agreements, and</li>
  <li>improve our services and your experience</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="vspacing-pd-sm">
  <h4>What information we share on the Site, with other Kivalia users and investors</h4>
  <p>If you submit a loan listing, it will automatically be allocated to one of two investment
  channels based on a random allocation methodology determined by us: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>The first allows investors on the Kivalia site to purchase loans through Kivalia.
  We share some of your information with investors. This is limited to your loan terms, repayment
  history and loan status, information about your most recent degree, current income, what you
  intended to use your loan proceeds for, and your credit score within a 10 point range.
  </li>
  <li>The second allows investors to purchase 100% of your loan directly from us. We provide
  information about you included in your application, including personally identifiable,
  financial, and credit information, and your loan terms to these investors in advance of their
  purchase of your loan. As the servicer of your loan we will also share information we obtain
  in servicing your loan, including about your repayments, to these investors, who become the
  creditor, or any subsequent purchaser of your loan.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have an income share agreement, we will share your name and information about your
  repayment history with investors in your income share agreement.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="vspacing-pd-sm">
  <h4>Referral Program</h4>
  <p>Our users can refer friends to the Site by completing a simple form to generate an
  email invitation. In this case, the email invitations do not track back to
  any particular loan listing, and the sender will not know whether you are a
  borrower, investor or simply a registered user. This information is stored for
  the sole purpose of sending emails to such referred customers and tracking the success
  of our referral program. In the case where a bonus is offered to a user in return
  for the referral we will only retain the information about the referred parties
  to properly credit the account of the user initiating the referral.
  The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="vspacing-pd-sm">
  <h4>What information we share with third parties</h4>
  <p>
  All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday
  business. We may share your personal information with:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Trustees overseeing Kivalia, including Bankers Company, not in its
  individual capacity but solely as indenture trustee and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB
  d/b/a Christiana not in its individual capacity but solely as owner trustee.</li>
  <li>if you apply for a loan, the creditor, currently  who originates all the
  loans on the Site and any investor who purchase 100% of your loan (but not an
  investor in Kivalia).</li>
  <li>Service providers who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention,
  bill collection, marketing and technology services, and financial institutions that we partner
  with to offer a product and/or support our servicing activities. Our contracts dictate that
  these third parties only use your information in connection with the services they perform for
  us and not for their own benefit.</li>
  <li>Credit bureaus to report account information, as permitted by law.</li>
  <li>Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by, or companies we plan to sell, divest
  or transfer all or a portion of our products and/or services to, including any back-up service
  provider or back-up administrator we or Kivalia engage in the event we stop
  operating.</li>
  <li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when (1) we are compelled to
  do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, (2) we need to do so to comply
  with law, or (3) if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of your personal information
  is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal
  activity.</li>
  <li>Other third parties but only if you consent or direct us to do so.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Kivalia will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their
  marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described
  above.
  </p>
  <p>
  Information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user is not
  considered personal information. Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of
  your personal information in certain instances such as sharing your information so that third
  parties can market to you. However, because we will not share your information in these instances,
  there is no need for you to opt-out from the information we share.

  <h4>How we protect your information and use cookies</h4>
  <p>
  We protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use by maintaining physical,
  electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable law. These measures include
  computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. We authorize our employees to get your
  information only when they need it to do their work, and we require companies that work for us
  to protect your information.
  </p>
  <p>
  When you access the Site or content or use the products or services available through the Site,
  we (or companies we work with) may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on your
  computer or other device. We use these technologies to recognize you as a customer; customize our
  services, content and advertising; collect information about your computer or other access device
  to mitigate risk and help prevent fraud.  You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or
  browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of the Site. The help legal
  section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides instructions on blocking, deleting or
  disabling cookies. We do not transmit any personal or sensitive information to advertising partners.
  However, certain partners may collect incoming IP addresses in connection with your visits to our
  Site, for example, to avoid double counting the number of new members who joined as a result of
  an advertising campaign.
  </p>
  <p>
  In the event that any of your information that we control is compromised as a result of a breach
  of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate,
  notify you and take other steps in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
  </p>
  <p>
  Upon termination or deactivation of your Kivalia account on the Site, we may retain your profile
  information and user content and information for backup, archival, or audit purposes.

  <h4>Links to or from other websites and services</h4>
  <p>
  We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the
  Site, including any information or content they contain. Please remember that when you use a
  link to go from the Site to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those
  third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or
  service, including those that have a link or advertisement on the Site, are subject to that
  third party’s own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and we
  do not control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your user content. If you are
  using a third-party website or service (like LinkedIn) and you allow such a third-party access
  to your user content, you do so at your own risk.
